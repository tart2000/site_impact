Description: Building on more than 10 years of growing a Canada wide caregiver community and stakeholder relations through The Caregiver Network, Huddol will innovate the future of caregiver support in Canada.  Huddol is an intelligent social network that uses needs based input from caregivers to connect them to relevant networks of care, or, “Huddols”. Huddols are groups of like-lifed caregivers, service providers, health care experts and community allies working together to improve health care outcomes. Building on the power of social sharing, Huddol breaks the isolation faced by caregivers and empowers them with the knowledge to improve decision making and increase access to support.
